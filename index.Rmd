# Overview

> "And though she be but little, she is fierce."
> -- Shakespeare, on receiving an NVIDIA Jetson Nano for his birthday

The goal of the `edgyR` project is to give R (and Julia!) users access to
[NVIDIA Jetson development kits](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/develop/hardware).
Although the target market of the Jetson platform is autonomous vehicles, and
the focus of the NVIDIA software is image and video processing, the hardware and
software are general enough for a wide variety of scientific computing
applications.

The initial release is aimed at R package developers. I'm assuming a knowledge
of R, RStudio, Git, and R Markdown. The release contains everything an R
package developer should need to develop packages that interface with the
unique hardware of the Jetson platform. It also contains a JupyterLab
server Python users more familiar with that environment.

The Jetson hardware consists of a multi-core `arm64` CPU and a CUDA-compatible
GPU. The smallest of the family, the Jetson Nano, has four CPU cores, 4 GB of
RAM, and an NVIDIA Maxwell GPU with 128 CUDA cores. The peak speed is 472 billion floating
point operations per second (GFLOPS).

The largest, the Jetson AGX Xavier, has eight CPU cores, 32 GB of RAM, and a
Volta GPU with 64 tensor cores and 512 CUDA cores. The peak speed of the AGX Xavier
is 32 trillion operations per second. 

The Jetson software is called
[JetPack](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack).
JetPack includes

* [Linux for Tegra (L4T)](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/linux-tegra),
a full Ubuntu 18.04 LTS "Bionic Beaver" desktop,
* NVIDIA drivers,
* compilers, linkers and libraries to access the onboard GPU in C/C++ and
Python, and
* a complete NVIDIA Docker runtime.

`edgyR` adds R 4.0.3 and RStudio Server 1.4.1103 to JetPack, compiled for `arm64`
from upstream source and packaged on a Docker image,
[`edgyr`](https://hub.docker.com/r/edgyr/edgyr).
The image is based on
[NVIDIA L4T Base](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:l4t-base).

## How is it pronounced?

There are (at least) five options:

1. ED-grrr
2. ED-gyre
3. EDGE-er
4. Edgier
5. Edgy R

It is ***not*** pronounced like any brand of peanut butter. Otherwise, it's
your choice!
