# Introduction

## Goals

> "And though she be but little, she is fierce." -- Shakespeare, on receiving an NVIDIA Jetson Nano for his birthday

The goal of the `edgyR` project is to give R deveopers access to [NVIDIA Jetson development kits](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/develop/hardware). Although the target market of the Jetson platform is autonomous vehicles, and the focus of the NVIDIA software is image and video processing, the hardware and software are general enough for a wide variety of scientific computing applications.

The initial release is aimed at R package developers. I'm assuming a knowledge of R, RStudio, Git, and R Markdown. The release contains everything an R package developer should need to develop packages that interface with the unique hardware of the Jetson platform. It also contains a JupyterLab server and Python data science stack, for Python users more familiar with that environment.

## How is it pronounced?

There are (at least) five options:

1.  ED-grrr
2.  ED-gyre
3.  EDGE-er
4.  Edgier
5.  Edgy R

It is ***not*** pronounced like any brand of peanut butter. Otherwise, it's your choice!
